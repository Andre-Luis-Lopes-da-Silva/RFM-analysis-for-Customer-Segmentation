# RFM-analysis-for-Customer-Segmentation
This is an implementation of Recency, Frequency and Monetary value (RFM) analysis used for customer segmentation.

The success or failure of businesses relies on a variety of factors. As the primary source of income for businesses, customers might be described as valuable, intangible assets for businesses that directly correspond to financial outcomes. 

Recency, frequency, monetary value (RFM) is a marketing analysis tool used to identify a firm's best clients based on the nature of their spending habits.

RFM analysis is a marketing technique used to quantitatively rank and group customers based on the recency, frequency and monetary total of their recent transactions to identify the best customers and perform targeted marketing campaigns. 

RFM analysis ranks each customer on the following factors:

* **Recency.** How recent was the customer's last purchase? Customers who recently made a purchase will still have the product on their mind and are more likely to purchase or use the product again. Businesses often measure recency in days. But, depending on the product, they may measure it in years, weeks or even hours.

* **Frequency.** How often did this customer make a purchase in a given period? Customers who purchased once are often are more likely to purchase again. Additionally, first time customers may be good targets for follow-up advertising to convert them into more frequent customers.

* **Monetary.** How much money did the customer spend in a given period? Customers who spend a lot of money are more likely to spend money in the future and have a high value to a business.
